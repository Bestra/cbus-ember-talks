# Background

- Rails Backend
- Mostly server rendered
- Reactjs on interaction-heavy pages

---

# Team

- 4 devs, eventually 10 in two locations
- Everyone cross-functional

---

# Turning point

- Turbolinks and pushState for routing
- Data fetching logic dispersed through the app
- Hard to get consensus on architecture as the project grew

---

# Early Challenges

- Mapping STI to Ember Data
â€” Where to put logic?
- How and when to serialize data
- Testing
- Going off the happy path

---

# Ember Data

- Server Sent Events
- SSOT problems
- Where to put logic?

---
> This is so easy with Ember Data
-- Every dev on the team

> This would be so much easier without Ember Data
-- Every dev on the team

---

# Mindfulness of Quirks
- SSOT
- ReduceComputed
- Store APIs (find, fetch, all, filter, yada yada)

---

# Components

- At first, widgets only
- Soon, everywhere?
- Where does the logic go?

---

# Services
- Arguably the happy place for logic


---

# Build Tools
- Ember CLI is pretty great
- Switching to Ember CLI was pretty terrible

---

# Lately
- Keeping up with changes can feel like a full time job
- A few guys on the team become "The Ember Guys"
- Glimmer has removed some of the Quirks

---


# Overall
- State on the client makes everything harder
- Ember and Ember Data APIs are continuously getting better
